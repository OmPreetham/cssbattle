# My CSS Battles Repository

Welcome to my repository where I showcase my results from various CSS battles challenges!

## What is CSS Battles?

CSS Battles is a platform where developers compete by creating CSS-only images based on a given prompt or challenge. It's a fun way to test and improve your CSS skills while learning new techniques.

## Instructions

```html
<!-- OBJECTIVE -->
<!-- Write HTML/CSS in this editor and replicate the given target image in the least code possible. What you write here, renders as it is -->

<!-- SCORING -->
<!-- The score is calculated based on the number of characters you use (this comment included :P) and how close you replicate the image. Read the FAQS (https://cssbattle.dev/faqs) for more info. -->

<!-- IMPORTANT: remove the comments before submitting -->
```
